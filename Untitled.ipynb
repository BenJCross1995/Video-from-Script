Mandela was an anti-apartheid revolutionary, politician, and philanthropist who served as the President of South Africa from 1994 to 1999. He was the country's first black head of state, breaking the barriers of racial inequality. Mandela spent 27 years in prison, from 1962 to 1990, for his activism against apartheid.

Mandela played a pivotal role in negotiating the end of apartheid and fostering a peaceful transition to democracy in South Africa.

      "Albert Einstein was born on March 14, 1879, in Ulm, Germany. He was the son of Hermann Einstein, a salesman, and Pauline Koch, a housewife. He had one sister, Maja. Einstein's parents were secular Jews, but Einstein was not a religious person himself. Einstein was a bright child, but he had difficulty in school. He was expelled from school at the age of 15 for being a disruptive student. He later said that he was \"not a good student because I did not learn the same way as other children.\"\n",

      "Einstein failed his first college entrance exam, but was later admitted to the Swiss Federal Polytechnic School in Zurich. He was accepted on the condition that he first finish his formal schooling. He graduated in 1900 with a degree in physics. Einstein developed the special theory of relativity in 1905, when he was just 26 years old. This theory revolutionized our understanding of space and time. It showed that mass and energy are equivalent, and that the speed of light is the ultimate speed limit in the universe. Einstein developed\n",

It has been used to make accurate predictions about the behaviour of black holes and other astronomical phenomena. Einstein won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921 for his work on the photoelectric effect. This effect shows that light can behave as both a wave and a particle. It was a major breakthrough in our understanding of light and matter. Einstein was a pacifist\n",

Einstein was a talented violinist and loved to play classical music. He also enjoyed sailing, hiking, and playing the piano. He was a member of the Swiss-German Club of Scientists and Artists, and he often played chamber music with his fellow members.

They have found that his brain had some unusual features, such as a larger-than-average parietal lobe, which is associated with spatial reasoning. Einstein was a very creative thinker and came up with many of his ideas while daydreaming. He would often sit in his office and stare out the window, thinking about the universe.
